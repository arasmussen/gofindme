# Go Find Me

Go Find Me is an app that tells you which neighborhood you're in in a novel way.

We're building it with React Native and Exponent so that you can follow along as we build it.

We're also livestreaming our hackathon: https://www.facebook.com/raz/videos/10153527610821629/

Download Exponent and open http://exp.host/@andrew/gofindme to use the app as we build it. We'll published updates as we go.
